#Github Key:
export GITHUB_TOKEN="token" in the terminal before running cargo run

#Languages:
We noticed that it said C/C++ and wasn't sure if it was one or both, so we opted to find repos of both C and C++, leading to Rust, Java, C, and C++ for 4 languages

#Forks:
When looking through the commits for the 20 most recent forked repos, we went through up to 10 commits to count the number of new commits in the forked repos

#Redis:
As part D came after part C, We assumed that we were to save the top repo per language we cloned in part C into Redis
