Languages:
We noticed that it said C/C++ and wasn't sure if it was one or both, so we opted to find 
repos of both C and C++, leading to Rust, Java, C, and C++ for 4 languages

Forks:
When looking through the commits for the 20 most recent forked repos, 
we went through 10 commits

Redis: 
As part D came after part C, 
We assumed that we were to save the top repo per language we cloned in part C into Redis
